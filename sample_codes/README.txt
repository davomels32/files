How to run:
- Copy files to a folder and run with Python 3.8+
- For GUI apps, run the file and choose GUI when asked or run directly.
- Data files (JSON) will be created in the folder when you add data.

Enjoy! - I followed your coding style (from tkinter import *, procedural functions, simple comments)
